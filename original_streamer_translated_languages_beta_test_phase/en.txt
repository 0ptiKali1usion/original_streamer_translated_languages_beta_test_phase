rattling [Music] all right uh take two the original streamer have you ever felt like a natural-born loser or maybe not that maybe have you ever felt like you just don't know if you've made a contribution to humanity to humankind anything that'll ever be remembered well i suppose that's how i was feeling the day i contacted jason scott over twitter in like a private message because uh well i'd been watching star trek and yeah it was that episode with the uh the uh all right you know what we'll get back to this chapter all right or this intro let's try and figure out something else what's a good story i'd like to tell i know i got a few all right let's see let's see come on man come on got something right probably i hope so trying to write a book hmm hmm all right this one sounds like fun so uh cyber censorship at the public access tv studio in the lobby area on the first floor after you walk through the front door and past the sign-in desk they decided to install some public internet terminals yes they started out as pcs you know they could have been 486s i suppose and then eventually they installed imacs but while they were using pcs they were running microsoft windows 3.11 windows for work groups and yes folks they installed cyber censorship software otherwise known as a net nanny or a filter and yes it sucked it didn't just suck for kids that you know it sucked for the membership as well i suppose on public internet terminals it is usually a good idea to have some form of control in terms of what people are going to be looking up online with these public terminals because hey they could be looking up all kinds of disturbing things which could be causing disturbing circumstances wherever they may be okay but i gotta admit at the tv studio there were all kinds of disturbing tv shows if you will truly and if if the producers were indeed going to prepare for their disturbing programs sometimes it really help to be able to do so online um so what to do what to do back then there were only a handful of censorship software titles available you know or what you would call parental control programs stuff like net nanny and cyber patrol were the two dominant titles both consisting of titles that impose some type of authority figure in the form of a human but still represented through a program you know what i mean a nanny is a nanny you know a patrol is a patrol so you're supposed to make these uh correlations in the equations yourself and decide which you prefer do you want to nanny your kids or do you want to patrol your kids oh bad ah i gotta admit i really do hate censorship still to this day kinda goes against everything i believe in namely that all information longs to be free most people think that sounds crazy usually saying things like all information you don't mean all the information do you it's like well i would say so yes in one form or another you know available and disseminated appropriately as the case may be you know with the proper avenues and access routes available to get this information yes [ __ ] yes so anyways where was i oh yes at the tv studio they had decided to install cyber patrol so that's right we were on high alert folks oh yes you better watch yourself don't get in any trouble now well the net terminals are on patrol anyways it seriously did suck because there were so many websites that you couldn't go to like and it these net terminals they didn't have cyber patrol at first like we had a good few months probably without any kind of controls in place obviously windows 3.11 for work groups did not have any types of censorship controls for online types of things because windows 3.11 barely had anything it barely had a calculator and a clock it barely had a file manager so and the fact they called it windows for work groups you know they added the extra one as opposed to windows 3 1. yeah you know it barely had network access truly most people added internet access through windsock you can go look that up if you want to right now we're talking about cyber patrol and uh it could have been a token ring network could have just been tcp maybe nobel i can't remember but i do know that cyber patrol was messing things up for everybody and well it just so happens that uh i i searched online for a way to circumvent cyber patrol and yes found one in the form of an ms-dos batch file that worked very effectively the nice thing about it was you could disable disable cyber patrol when you ran it the first time and when you ran it the second time it would re-enable cyber patrol so that way no one would be the wiser of course some of the membership noticed i was accessing websites that uh i probably should not be able to access and they they just had to shoulder surf a little harder and figure out what was going on sometimes that was enough for the membership to satisfy their curiosity and knowing that such a thing could be done while other producers actually felt the need to talk to me and ask questions i'm pretty sure this was around the time i met bill allmach a local producer and a person that was a radio had a history in radio he asked me hey zot how are you going to that website of course i was taken aback in fact i was scared shitless because i didn't really think anybody knew what i was doing and on top of that i was thinking how does this guy know my name am i busted holy crap but uh no bill was just curious and probably wanting to know so he could uh further his own online curiosity satisfaction so i reacted quickly seeming startled saying what huh who me i'm not doing anything suddenly realizing that maybe the front desk receptionist might be able to hear me or the member services representative as some people called them so i toned it down a notch and asked this guy what are you talking about who are you what do you want bill introduced himself and reassured me that he was a producer just like me and that he was familiar with many of the people i was familiar with down there at the public access television studio and then he uh asked me again so is it just me or are you accessing websites that you should not be able to access azot and i say to bill i say well i think i should be able to access them and he let out a hearty laugh to that indeed zot indeed bill seemed like a pretty nice guy pretty good humored individual so i figured i'd let him in on the secret i informed him yeah okay i'm running a little program off this floppy disk that i brought with me and uh it lets me get around the cyber patrol okay and uh you know before i leave i run it again to turn cyber patrol back on take my floppy disk with me and so far nobody is the wiser and or nobody knows better since i already said the wiser earlier and i'm trying to write a book here all right so of course bill finds this all very interesting but his tone is finally starting to hush down a little bit realizing that i was trying to speak in a hushed tone and like hey hey buddy keep it down the lyrics that kind of a thing so he was uh curious if he could borrow my floppy disk and try it himself i quickly shut down the web browser ran the program the batch file off of the floppy closed the ms-dos command prompt window ejected the three and a half inch floppy disk gave it to him and said here just keep it i can make another one good luck and we became fast friends after that for many years yes we even worked on a program together called underground music videos well after video games and more was completely over with bill was just another one of the many producers at axis tucson that knew how to get himself into trouble much like myself except the way bill would get himself into trouble is by over producing several years down the line after i joined the studio there was a policy implemented that each producer each member of the facility could only have two programs under their belt at once and that was it if you had more than that you were gonna get in trouble anything from suspended to possibly kicked out i mean it was basically all in the determination it was on the subjective opinion of the uh the head staff of the outfit yeah i can probably say that better write that better but anyways so he i recall one point when bill had nine different programs that he was producing mostly musical in nature such as celtic music and more underground music videos and well just about anything you could imagine like i said bill had a background in radio so he kind of had a knack for that sort of thing and it was a natural conversion for him to switch from radio to music video but yes alas when the staff and when the organizers finally realized that he had something like eight or nine programs going at once they quickly put a stop to that and curtailed his actions quite frankly i believe they were shocked that he was able to pull off such a thing but bill was pretty savvy and familiar with the system they had there there was a way to get around it all right because you see each producer of each program could have a so-called co-producer and bill managed to make himself the co-producer of most of his programs yes i suppose i was an enabler i suppose i was a bit of a oh what do they call that uh i guess isn't there another name for that though when you help people justify uh all right anyways yes i guess i was a bit of an enabler or perhaps a total enabler by agreeing to produce underground music videos for bill essentially but how could i say no this guy had new dvds all the time of really cool stuff totally underground rock videos that i had never seen before like the kind of stuff they weren't playing on mtv you know so i was definitely getting something out of it plus i was very busy at the time having reached adulthood basically and now having to pursue work in order to pay my rent so me and my significant other could afford to live in stuff and also go to school and try to earn my college degree in a relatively normal amount of time they do call it a two-year college after all and it was nice having a way to maintain some kind of status some kind of connection and some kind of way to socialize at the television studio even though i really didn't have the time to produce anymore i was still producing that's right thank you bill all right that seemed like a pretty decent uh decent way yeah i like that i like that that all worked all right stop all right here's another chapter so yes when i first started hanging out at public access i developed a bit of a reputation as a rambunctious wild and hyper active kid i suppose it was because i could be seen all over the place at any given moment usually i was just trying to hang out with the other kids there basically oh sorry machine made a noise basically i was just trying to hang out with the other kids there or hang out with the girls is the case maybe yes omi or omeglier and stephanie or just steffy were quite fond of running around the whole studio like they own the place oftentimes wanting to go down to the basement to play games or tell stories using the various props that were available for producers to use and stored down in the basement yes it was a very interesting array of just the most random stuff mannequins umbrellas uh i i think i think pretty much if somebody left something down in the basement it just stayed there i don't believe there was a catalog or anything of actual items that people kept down there so and yes the piles grew to be quite high allowing us to crawl around hide under things hop over things and such and there were even wigs and various clothes that we could use as costumes to get even sillier than we already were being of course we couldn't stay down there forever after all we were there with our parental figures parental units if you will [Music] steffy the daughter of shane eden omelier the daughter of lou golden and ruth golden and me well you know me so after a good amount of time had passed and we had noticed on the round wall clock we would either all stroll to the elevator and ride our way up to where the studios were or if we just couldn't control ourselves we'd go storming up the steps all the way from the basement through the first floor up to the second whatever made the most sense at the time really and of course if we were gonna go ahead and storm up the stairs up the steps like that it only made sense to continue running down the hallway and then eventually flinging the door open to studio a or studio b and then running into the studio to well just let uh our parents know that we were okay let our presence be known with a quick circle around the studio and then back out the door again yes i guess it was pretty crazy we were all preteens and i suppose none of us were particularly hyper active per se but once we got around each other and had a chance to play the hyper activity was only natural for some reason the ah excuse me for some reason people were calling me mini horowitz i believe that nickname had started over in studio b at the forbidden zone produced by marty cattola and hosted by him and cliff campbell cliff was probably his co-producer i can't remember go look it up on youtube if you want to still i don't know why i was called mini horowitz what the hell is a horowitz hmm i suppose i should go look that up but that was just one of the nicknames that they were throwing around for me the short fast and seemingly everywhere kid that they had yet to meet yes the kid wearing the van's tennis shoes or maybe air walks and the stucy hat you know the kind the floppy steucey yeah floppy hats blah blah and crazy t-shirts like for example artwork by the artist puss head known for his metallica album cover artwork as luck would have it [Music] my mom would end up working crew for the forbidden zone at some point i can't remember if it was audio or camera something like that but yeah so you know what that means yeah when we were playing in the basement we'd have to run up to studio b every once in a while so i could let my mom know i was still alive and breathing and hadn't been abducted by aliens or something like that so it was around that time i became familiar with these nicknames that were being used for me stuff like mini horowitz and zot seemed to me that marty preferred many horowitz but most everybody else was favoring zot of course i knew not what either of those meant or what they were about but it all seemed fun to me and i was not bothered by the fact that i had a nickname or two so yes as time passed i got to participate with the forbidden zone guys in various ways such as even starring in a little skit or sketch you could say where i got to play a crank caller of all things and marty got to meet the crank caller and basically pummel him much like j and silent bob oops was that a spoiler i hope not anyhow where was i oh yes and of course cliff was acting as the humble narrator you can go look that up on youtube too if you want probably funny stuff i tell you what all right i could go on about further adventures with the forbidden zone guys but this was basically the era yes the era where i got my nickname and uh yes that was that was basically before i became an actual member or producer and uh crew member um and before i knew how to do anything down there and was basically just hanging out yep all right yes hanging out at the tv studio was a nice fun escape from reality for me even at the end even at the tender age even at the tender pre-teen age of 10 years old i still needed an escape from reality at that time yes it was around 1991 or so new kids on the block were very popular as was mc hammer vanilla ice and faith no more anyhow i was going to tully elementary school for the fourth grade over in barrio hollywood area of tucson and i was miserable because yet again i was a new kid having transferred from corbett elementary where i was a third grader friendless very alone and basically getting well you say schooled basically getting told what to do by anybody that decided they felt the need to because i don't know if you realize this or not but cool kids they don't pull their socks up all right they scrunch them down around their ankles so if you wear your socks up around your calves that is so nerdy i'm just letting you know at least that's how it was back then that's right and of course all the cool girls had their new kids on the block buttons on their desks right where they would keep their pencils in the built-in groove of the average desk of course these were not your average buttons no these were oversized and well what can i say i guess every girl needs a heartthrob or two or three or four or five to grow up with right oh man and of course all the other standard things such as slap bracelets and clackers which were these balls that collect back and forth and were very noisy quite rhythmic anyway i could care less about any of those things because i was apart from my father yes he had been on a drunken alcohol binge bender for the past year or so and it was basically horrible for me having grown up with him for the previous 10 years i had grown accustomed to him in his funny ways what i mean is it was nice when he made me macaroni and cheese for dinner or lunch it was nice when he made me scrambled eggs for breakfast it was nice when he took me to school and my mom would pick me up from school or it was nice when he would bring his guitar to school for show and tell or you know what do your parents do for work day whatever they call that vocation day yeah it was safe to say in kindergarten for sure i was undoubtedly the coolest and luckiest kid there my father performed such hit numbers as somewhere over the rainbow and la bamba so yeah granted it wasn't always fun and games with my old man no i suppose technically he was mentally ill and when i say technically i mean basically that when he needed to he would get checked into mental institutions all over town varying from tucson psychiatric institute charter lark kino and well i don't know just about any place that would take him i'm sure you can guess that it wouldn't take long for him to start singing songs playing guitar or piano or whatever was in there and getting the entire staff and patience as well to just love him to pieces even though when he checked in he could be anywhere from ranting raving and angry to just overdosed and completely out of it yeah he he uh my pops could get pretty stressed out you know i mean playing music wasn't exactly the steadiest gig so sometimes things were going good other times not so good and you could usually tell how things were going based on how crazy he was of course my mother had a theory that he had a self-defeating habit about him where if he was ever doing too good or getting too close to major success he would just have to sabotage himself before he could actually attain super stardom and riches beyond belief but that was her personal opinion and hers alone personally i think his attitude was usually more circumstantial rather than actual plotting or self-control whether it be destructive or non-destructive but yes i'm just trying to let you know some insight because that year the year of the new kids on the block was a very lonely one for me i had already spent a good chunk of it without him and had even spent some time in a women's shelter with my mother where we were basically hiding out from him hiding out because he had left some really nasty vulgar scary phone messages on the house answering machine when he was drunk yeah not a happy drunk unfortunately but rather an over drinker if you will and i believe i can safely state that when most humans over drink the outcomes are unpredictable at best and usually destructive to the drinker and those around as well particularly if blacking out is a part of the over drinking equation as was the case with my father sometimes so naturally i did not blame my mother for hiding from that crazy sob no i suppose at first i thought it made sense and i was quite glad to be out of reach he was being scarier than i had ever seen him in my life which was saying quite a lot but no person is entirely bad and of course as time went by i missed his funny and helpful and well i missed my father [Music] so yes running away from school to the tv studio where i was free to play with my friends that actually knew me and didn't boss me around and to hang out with my familiar adult friends and producers that were all so unique and interesting in their own ways if i stopped playing and bothered to pay attention also i had acquired my first real skateboard during that time yes you guessed it my father taught me to skateboard a few years earlier but that was on a banana board and it really stunk it was a puny crummy little thing compared to my world industries jeremy klein super mario deck that my mom had helped score for my birthday yeah i suppose those times had their ups and their downs that's for sure especially when i was skating up and down hills oh yeah you like that it's kind of funny right nice little yeah well i suppose our separation couldn't last forever actually only about a year we had caught wind caught word that my father was in the hospital yes the hospital i was born in apparently he was there because he had almost died he had been drinking where he lived with his friends and neighbors which was apparently his habit for the past year and well that habit had led to a bleeding stomach ulcer and he basically vomited up all the blood in his body if you can believe that there's only eight pints after all that's not that much when you're just spewing it out of your mouth like a water fountain luckily his neighbor and friend scott i guess had called an ambulance and luckily that ambulance was quick and luckily the doctors at the hospital were quick with their balloons filled with blood transfusion blood because had they not been he most certainly would have been dead longer than the 30 seconds that he was clinically dead for probably would have been dead forever actually anyhow when we heard about that little piece of news we talked about it and decided we should go visit him basically we decided that he couldn't be a threat at this point up in a hospital bed nearly dead which of course had been the main reason we had avoided him for the past year i didn't know how to feel at first kind of a mixture of things but when we got to his hospital room after reading the number off the door i saw him and he said and uh i went running up and hugged him throwing myself on top of his hospital patient bed and started crying saying daddy you daddy you daddy you daddy you i missed you daddy you so we were united and reunited once again basically never to part ways for too long or for bad reasons ever again things did get less lonely for me towards the end of fourth grade but of course they would get lonely again when i transferred to a new school for the fifth grade so yes for the fifth grade it was official i was a full-blown skater dude if you will wearing crazy clothing like santa monica airlines skateboard company t-shirts with charles manson on the front limpy's shorts that were well anything but short let's say and even dr martin combat boots all the way up to my knees i can't remember how many eyelets it was but i'm sure you know because you're cool right anyhow nobody else at my school really dressed that way except for the middle schoolers who were much much older than me yes at this elementary school they also had 7th and 8th graders and man i thought those kids had it going on with mohawk hairdos dead kennedy's t-shirts and yeah just total punks boy i tell you i felt like i was hanging out with a bunch of squares there in the fifth grade where i was more likely to get made fun of as opposed to complimented for my awesome threads and style yes but i guess i was shy or maybe it was the school schedule like i don't know i never really hung out with those middle schooler guys no now i was kind of just sticking with my own grade and well i suppose none of it would have really mattered because being the new kid is pretty much always a guaranteed bum trip for me i it takes time for me to make friends apparently i i guess i'm shy maybe i or maybe i was i don't know but yeah it was still nice being a full-fledged skater dude because my skater die attitude basically kept me happy and my sony discman certainly did as well especially the battery-powered speakers computer speakers that i would carry around in a lunchbox type bag and listen to my cool skater tunes like fish bone and faith no more whom i had become very familiar with at that point the red hot chili peppers who i had already acquired two compact discs the abbey road ep which was my first and the mother's milk album which i probably played every day and well i guess you get the picture [Music] [Music] still though i could hardly wait or i don't know i had to get the hell out of that place and get back to the tv studio where i could hang with my real friends and yes get back to producing because i had become a full-fledged member at that point and was producing and editing and field camering and basically just having a blast in fact i managed to get two skateboard focused productions made during that time period the first one being nameless skaters which was a local skateboarder and uh teenager based documentary of sorts basically getting a feel for what the kids were going through on a daily basis whether it be getting hassled to leave the areas where they were skating or [Music] uh that's getting hassled and basically what else were they going through basically getting hazzled yeah man but because they were underage i obfuscated their identities using various video graphics effects like mosaic and posterize and then to focus on them for a skateboard type music video thing after the interview it was a whole lot of fun and my mom helped interview everybody helped me carry the camera and well basically helped me and i was just so grateful that she did that and kind of never wanted that day to end but when the sun started to set and when the skaters started ollying over orange cones at the tucson convention center it was about time to call it and i managed to enter that just in the nick of time for the oasis awards the local public access awards ceremony to honor the best productions that had been made and released that year i did not actually win but just hearing my name was great and having everybody know that i was the producer of nameless skaters was just totally awesome radical bodacious and well bad to the bone let's say and yes it only took about a year down the road for me to go to the downtown performance center of all places where they were having the organ grinder skateboard tour featuring guinness book of world records holder christian hasoy yes the man who had acquired the most air on a half pipe holy wow and bill danforth and eddie radagi bill danforth was a street skater supreme being able to carve grind slide and basically just get his way around anything anywhere all over the place and eddie radagi was a entrepreneur with his public skateboard company as it was called of course let's not forget that christian hasoy had also become a recent entrepreneur around this time with his msg or milk skateboard goods company yes these awesome radical dudes got to set up a half pipe inside the downtown performance center for their tour and i got to film it oh yeah and i got to interview each each i don't want to say radical again but damn it they're radical i got to interview each radical skater as well with the assistance of my mom once again wow what a cool mom right it was uh amusing attempting to interview bill danforth notorious for his tattooed shirtless appearance not sure where to place the clip-on lavalier microphone he suggested we just use his nipple ring which indeed worked perfectly and yeah it's on youtube go look it up oh yeah and here i am about what 30 years still talking about that like as if i'm some kind of badass for something i did before i had hair on my balls [Music] well what can i say i was pretty badass for a prepubescent pre-teen fna i was skate or die [Music] all right this is the chapter where i talk about leaving the sixth grade yes by the time i was in the sixth grade i was kind of starting to fit in at my new school having actually lasted from the tail end of fourth grade through fifth grade and yes now into sixth grade probably the longest stint or the longest amount of time i had spent at one school and the most sequential the most consecutive grades in a row yes i guess i felt like maybe i was starting to fit in it wasn't terribly difficult i suppose there were only several groups of kids if you will or subcultures there was basically the nerds who usually were talking about turbografx 16 games such as splatterhouse and i think keith of courage wasn't that another one i don't know because i didn't have a turbografx16 which kind of made talking about bonk's adventure a little bit difficult yes so uh aside from the geeks who else was there uh the bad kids yeah it wasn't a huge class no basically had a handful of geeks a handful of bad kids and then of course there were the girls but yeah if i was gonna hang out with the boys it was gonna be the bad kids essentially because the geeks didn't play my video game system and i don't know i guess it made me kind of want to noogie them and you know bully them which uh you know as luck would have it the bad kids thought that was pretty cool go figure my natural jealousy and rage it translated into cool points nice so what do cool kids do in the sixth grade well aside from bullying smoking cigarettes of course yeah i had figured out how to grab a pack off of the countertop at the local revco drugstore back when they used to keep packs up on the counter like that can you believe it yes no they were not always kept behind the counter but hey uh i don't know what to say to that really it's still hard to believe but hey at least the spray mouth freshener was also easy to steal as well because [Music] well let's just say i could not afford to get caught with smoker's breath i mean i was like a 12 year old sixth grader that would be crazy right well as we would sneak off to this uh area of the playground where there was like a building that wasn't used for anything it was a small little brick building i don't know could uh go around to the other side of the wall and hang out in the shade puffing our stoves sometimes camels sometimes marlboroughs um let me think what were those other ones uh i think they started with an m they were like uh metal met you know the one that they like the on sunny in philadelphia charlie wears a t-shirt from sometimes um oh yeah and there were mavericks you know all kind it's basically whatever i could get but uh as they're puffing away on our stoves trying not to cough too much naturally the bad kids would you know be coming up with bad ideas and of course the pass out game was one of the things i learned about where you put your hands on your neck and you lean over and you you hyperventilate and do that until you pass out and then basically your friends uh help you come too like i never actually did that no i just politely declined whenever they'd ask hey do you want me to help you come too jj i'd just be like nah i don't have time for that right now i don't want to go back to class all woozy so they were cool with that but i must say it was pretty creepy the way these kids would be standing there one moment and then just passing out and falling over the next but they said it was fun i still don't really know but anyways somehow we never really got in trouble i guess that building came in handy yep good days and good times for the bad kids but being bad wouldn't always be good for so long no because like i mentioned this would be the year that i leave the sixth grade yeah i i left all right because towards the end of the school year around photo daytime uh i had found an envelope of money on the ground about seven dollars yes and uh i was gonna keep it and go play video games at the 7-eleven after school preferably with at least one of my bad kid friends i mean what what fun is it to play street fighter all by yourself at the arcade machine so having quickly placed my foot over the envelope sliding it ever so smoothly close to me and then bending down to tie my shoes and pocketing it i approached a friend of mine the first the first bad kid i saw and said hey look what i got pulling the envelope about an inch or two out of my pocket and then uh of course my friend is like so what i'm getting my picture taken too i'm like oh no that's not my envelope and he says whose is it and i'm all i don't know somebody's and he got scared and for a bad kid he seemed really scared because i wasn't that scared but yes he got paranoid scared and said you gotta get rid of that ditch that before you get caught and i said i'm not gonna get caught i'm gonna go play video games at the 7-eleven maybe get a soda and some chips too maybe a candy bar too what's what's your problem oh dear this kid was spazzing bad and he said dude you gotta get rid of that man i can't be seen with that i'm gonna go tell on you and uh oh all of a sudden i knew why he was so scared and paranoid because i was feeling exactly the same way yeah i was uh all of a sudden kinda getting terrified but angry as well i said to my friend i said hey wait slow down you're not gonna tell on me why would you do that and he says because you're gonna get caught and i'm not gonna get in trouble with you i don't know why he was so certain i was gonna get in trouble that thought hadn't even crossed my mind i thought i was way too slick for that right so i say to him you better not tell on me or you're gonna regret it but at that point it was too late his back was turned and he was running towards the hall monitor and heading to the boys room and i couldn't believe it so i'm thinking quickly what do i do what do i do oh crap what do i do i decide to follow him to see what he plans on doing unfortunately the hall monitor only lets one kid go to the bathroom at a time so i had to wait until he exited out the other hallway and the monitor had seen oh boy i went running into the bathroom and into a stall and i had suddenly realized my hands were shaking and that i was freaking out because my friend was nowhere to be seen he had indicated that i was gonna get in trouble and that he was gonna tell on me and i literally had mere minutes until the bell would ring and i'd have to be back in class oh oh oh no well i can't afford to get in trouble that's that's not the way zot rolls so i did the only thing that made sense while standing in the lock stall i dropped the envelope in the toilet attempted to flush it failed because the envelope just sort of remained in the bowl and well i split yeah it didn't take long for somebody to find that envelope of money floating in the toilet and of course the hall monitor knew it had something to do with one of the kids who had been in the bathroom recently of course right so guess what me and my friend got called into the principal's office because it was basically either me or him that was responsible for the money and i guess they could figure out that it belonged to neither one of us considering pictures that already happened and nobody should have an envelope and it was neat neither one of us had a name on that envelope so yeah we shouldn't have had it and one of us was gonna be in big trouble if not both of us somehow i managed to accuse him well enough because the principal ended up calling his father in and his father ended up scolding him right in front of me yes scolding him to the point where he made him cry i was feeling like smiling at that point but i maintained control thinking to myself that's what that little snitch [ __ ] gets yeah i thought that i was in the clear and i thought i had done it in style like a true bad kid the only problem was eventually when i showed up in class and eventually when people had when the other students had heard what happened and somehow decided and understood that i was actually a liar and that that other poor poor kid was suffering as a result of me and my money thieving ways well let's just say the whole class was giving me dirty looks scowls or just ignoring me looking the other way pretending like i didn't exist and making me feel like a piece of dirt i really didn't understand how they could all side with that other kid i mean he was a bad kid too he hung out and with us while we were smoking and well i don't know he didn't smoke all the time i guess he was kind of a wishy-washy half bad kid kind of a wuss yeah well crap this wuss had turned the class against me and i was feeling it hard and didn't know how i was gonna make it to graduation this sucked it was really difficult i couldn't even borrow a pencil from anybody if i needed to i mean seriously you guys i was getting cold shouldered bad mouthed ignored and well i could tell i wasn't gonna last and told my mom it was time for me to leave i needed to get out of there i couldn't take the heat so my mother was not terribly excited about this but of course she knew about the money incident having been called into the principal's office to discuss it as well granted she was also thinking i was innocent much like the principal so when i explained that the class thought i was guilty and was treating me like i was guilty and making it impossible for me well i guess she felt bad and understood that it was going to be impossible for me to continue there so goodbye sixth grade all right well so now that i was free from that bothersome thing known as public school or the public school system yes i'll bet you can guess what happened next but before i dive deeply into more tv studio stories let's finish wrapping up my phase as a bad kid if you will because you see though i had basically voluntarily expelled myself and yeah though i was addicted to cigarettes at that point and though yeah i was skateboarding everywhere regardless of the no skateboarding signs or not and yeah basically uh yeah i was i was i was a pretty bad kid i guess by those standards but those days is standards anyhow playing mortal kombat whenever i got the chance yeah uh you know it was a rather natural progression because hey my father had always been the one to kind of crack the whip if you will or rather his belt just the mere cracking sound of his belt was enough to keep me on the straight and narrow most of my life obeying and following and yes being a good kid was oh so natural up until we had become separated and continued to basically live apart because even though we had started talking to my father again and seeing him know my folks would never live together again yes he had gotten too crazy this last time put my mom through just a little too much and though we were still a family and though they still loved each other well it just it wasn't gonna work they couldn't live together it was it was too much so it was easy to be a bad kid when he wasn't around i mean i kind of wanted to be a bad kid i was kind of mad that he wasn't around i was kind of upset being a bad kid it's kind of a nice uh nice way to vent but i guess it wouldn't last forever because i remember one time in particular my mom was working on a television show i was across the street at the cafe sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette yeah i didn't care who saw me what were they gonna do snitch me out to my mom she wouldn't believe them plus i had my minty spray breath freshener but surprisingly enough my father walked up on me from out of nowhere and tried to bum a butt off of me i made the motion like i was going to put it out but having then realized what he had said what he had asked for and taking the whole situation into context i just held my cigarette in my hand and fished my pack out of my pocket flipped the hard pack lid open allowing him to grab a stove and then flipping the lid back shut putting it back into my baggy shorts he then asked me if i had a light and yeah i had some matches no i hadn't quite learned about uh jump starting or somewhat some call goose [ __ ] or monkey [ __ ] or whatever basically i hadn't learned how to light a cigarette with the cherry yet so i gave him my matches too and well we just kind of hung out there puffing away it was awkward because well you know he he had he wasn't smoking at that time he wasn't smoking cigarettes he just like nearly died that was a bad idea right but then again i guess it was a bad idea for me too but we just sort of hung out and he sort of wrapped you know like like smokers do asking you know questions like so how long you've been puffing for and i told him not too long in my high pitched little kid voice and he says back to me he said yeah well i figured that much pretty funny i mean a little kid how long is a little kid gonna be smoking for not too long granted my old man he was kind of different you know being a musician and all i remember one of his favorite stories was about how when we were living on venice beach in california how when we were walking down the boardwalk some local or what have you offered to sell us some lsd for like five bucks for a hit yes the from out of nowhere some scroungy dude comes up and says hey you guys need any acid i got a hit for five bucks and my father would always tell the story where he said oh no thanks i don't need any but i replied back saying is it any good now come on i know maybe i was a bad kid around 10 12 years old but that venice beach story i was like seven or eight and i didn't really know what i was saying i was basically merely repeating what i had heard adults around me say on television movies or what have you but the way he would tell the story you could tell he got a kick out of it thinking it was pretty funny quite humorous so yes as we're just sort of wrapping puffing on our butt you know catching up as it was he said you better not let your mother catch you doing that she'll be really disappointed you wouldn't want to hurt her would you and i said to him of course no i would never want to hurt the lady that helped me film skateboarders professional and amateur no no i wouldn't want to hurt my mother the lady that quickly took me out of a dangerous environment that environment being school when the time seemed appropriate without question or hesitation trusting me oh so much yes i i could not lie i told him no i wouldn't want to hurt her and he said that's good mijo you should always be good to your mother always and i suppose that was the last cigarette i ever had as a preteen but yes it would seem that my bad kid days were coming to an end which made a lot of sense considering i was going to be busy at the television studio making money making uh helping with programming in any way possible because usually if you could volunteer as a cameraman an audio guy or even a grass valley switcher director you could earn a quick 10 bucks didn't seem like the character generator person was necessarily always worth 10 bucks though considering that the credits were usually saved on a floppy disk requiring little actual work from the character generator operator most of the time yeah it was a good racket making 10 bucks here and there i i remember one month i pocketed a hundred bucks pretty damn good for a kid yeah and sometimes i get to take that money to the arcade because now that my folks were basically split up if i wanted to spend time with my old man well let's just say it wasn't at my home so we found a convenient and good way to spend time was at the shopping mall or commonly referred to as the galleria part of the mall where there were places to eat a movie theater that had a few arcade games inside and even a real full-fledged arcade over by the food court places so yeah sometimes my old man would take me out to the movies other times i'd take him out it was cool we were just a couple of men like that you know hanging out i got to admit though he was still my father and you could tell by the way he would cheer for me every time i stepped up to the joystick and dropped a quarter beat the hell out of him yeah he did some dirty looks from my opponents but you know that actually worked to my advantage because i never looked away from the screen oh yeah granted it isn't like we were being jerks on the contrary the competition at the mall arcade was pretty stiff i mean just getting up to the machine was a challenge if you put your quarter up there on the ledge to indicate you wanted to play you were lucky if somebody didn't snag it when you weren't looking or if you weren't careful but my father there to make sure things went smooth i never really suffered too badly at the arcade nah it was pretty awesome actually especially during that golden era when street fighter mortal kombat and even primal rage virtua fighter mad dog mccree jeez just a bunch of great games were becoming available not to mention all my old favorites like double dragon donkey kong and donkey kong jr pac-man and well basically i could spend all day at the arcade if i had the choice or the chance but usually we had to get to the movie you know they do have a schedule after all and yeah in a way these times were actually almost better than growing up with my father but believe it or not my uncle his brother would become a producer down there at the tv studio after not too long and yeah once again i had another show to work another ten dollars to earn another close friend another producer that i knew yeah yeah it was quite the quite the tight-knit community i had going on you could say but really all that mattered to me was figuring out what in the hell was i gonna do as a producer because i really wanted to be like a fixture there and the only way to do that was by getting scheduled yeah you had to get a live program if you were gonna be anybody down there it's like yeah getting your pre-recorded programs that you had edited together getting that scheduled for cable cast was all fine and dandy i suppose you know but for people that were down there all the time hanging out working on programs live programs well it just didn't compare the energy the excitement the social scene and well let's just say i had to get a show of my own i had to figure out what i was gonna do and i had to figure out how to do it quick because man i was getting old time was flying by i didn't know what the future held really so i decided to get a facilitator appointment for a cable cast scheduling and live program block assigned to me me me of course i still had no idea what i was going to do but hey at least i had the appointment scheduled you know let me tell you i could write a book actually i could fill a book just talking about all the different programs and experiences and everything i could fill a book just talking about the other producers the staff just everything at that public access tv studio but this is a book about the original streamer so what can i say i'll stay focused on the original streamer but ah man it was such a scene down there at the tv studio there were so many different like different ideas different kinds of people like just i mean figuring out how to fit in could be a full-time job especially for a kid who hadn't like figured out or done any of the things that most of these programs were about i mean i guess the best way to determine if uh there was a particular scene or if you will if there was a particular subculture going on at the tv studio it would have been by if there were audiences yes you heard me if there were people in the audience during a particular filming of a show that was a good way to decide if there was an actual scene or subculture going on and i had already figured out several of the different scenes that were going on around me one of the uh more popular scenes was the religious programs which i had gladly worked on for cash here and there or even sometimes for free when i first started as a crew member down there but there were so many different shows so many different religions so many different folks all trying to get up in front of the camera and basically show their community that their religion was the best and try to recruit anybody they could to it and uh i'm serious christians echists jews muslims even hare krishnas though i had seen more hari krishnas on tape than in the studio in actuality my point is yes that was definitely a particular type of programming to consider as a producer but i knew i wasn't going to be doing that i mean yeah i'd been to church before or whatever but i mean to get up there in front of a camera and talk about that kind of stuff for for an hour oh come on i couldn't even do that for a half an hour heck i'd be lucky if i could do that for five minutes i mean i'd probably talk about easter and christmas over and over again you know what i mean but anyways there were definitely other ideas out there floating around i mean there was like this hemp for victory type of thing like this legalized hemp kind of vibe and programming going on where there were like hemp rallies that were videotaped and then shown on the air and then there were call-in talk shows where people would call in and talk about how awesome smoking dope was and just how great this show was and that it felt great to talk about smoking dope live on the air like these people thought it was the greatest thing ever just to talk about dope the thought hadn't quite crossed my mind yet that they were smoking dope while watching and calling but you know whatever i i didn't think too long or hard about that type of programming because i really wasn't qualified to talk about smoking dope no sorry yeah i'd smoke cigarettes but not quite yet initiated with the cannabis yet so again back to the drawing board hmm just what am i gonna use my time for because now that i wasn't going to school i did have the time to really just make a great program if i wanted to and i did i really thought that making those skateboard productions that i had made were man ah it was great holy crap i kind of wished i could just do that and strictly that but i had learned from experience that skateboarding in the studio was in fact a no-no so when i say back to the drawing board i'm thinking about the different programs and the different ideas gosh so many programs so many ideas there had been a show called dance club at one point and somehow the producers had managed to actually fill up studio a with just dozens of dancing kids just teenagers from all parts of town there were preppies vatos homies chicas blondies like man i'm telling you if if these were kids that enjoyed dancing to dance music they were there and they knew about it i mean i could only dream of having the producer type abilities and skills that it took to do something like that i mean to recruit all those kids on a regular basis get them to show up and then of course to have the music ready you know fresh tunes each week you know bumping thumping and well let's just say all grind worthy tunes man oh i wish i could have done that too but that was out of my league as well darn it this was getting tougher and tougher just so many good ideas but i really wasn't like qualified i just oh it just made me grip my teeth and and squint my eyes and well then open them again real wide look at my pad of paper grab my pencil so hard it was starting to splinter and crack and just tapping my eraser on that pad tap tap tap just trying to figure out what do i do what does a kid do what does a kid producer do in this town question my question my question was and yeah there were even more radical ideas that i knew i was not qualified to tackle kind of like the rocky horror picture show fanatics like charlie brown oh yeah i'd i'd basically gotten the gist of what that movie was about though i had never really seen it and i knew it was more of a musical than an actual movie as well i also knew it had a very adult reputation probably because of the product provocative clothing that was often worn by the attendees at the uh film screenings locally and uh yeah now and i also knew about uh the drag queen uh runway uh shows that were happening on the tony de nino's the g word every friday night or so and though those shows were almost as fun as dance club it was still not really my scene i mean let's just say i wasn't prepared to put on a dress at that point goodness gracious goodness gracious so many audience members it's true each one of those programs had tons of fans i could just latch on to their fan base and coast for god knows how long i suppose the ideal situation would have been for me to do that and then for the producer to like drop dead or move away or something and then i could totally take over but no no no that's i did not need to do that i did not want to do that and well i i was going to find my voice damn it whether it killed me or maybe just made me hoarse i would find my voice granted there were still more ideas to be looked at if you can believe it there was actually a strong ufo community happening down there thanks to ted loman and his ufo az people yes and it was an interesting time for ufo people because of great science fiction like the x-files alienation war of the worlds and writers like whitley streeper man what a far out topic that was i'll be honest i didn't know if i believed in aliens or not i mean yeah ufos aliens all that junk it's fun to think about and science fiction was a pretty cool genre of fiction and ufos well let's just say falling into that world would have been real easy for me i mean heck i already played video games that had aliens in them kind of like metroid but yeah nah i got a pass granted that ufo show wasn't the only one in town talking about aliens or alien cover-ups as the case may be yes there were people down there talking about crazy things like area 51 yes these folks were the conspiracy crowd friends of mine like roger sheer and trevor harvey and well basically people that let's just say i don't know if i should be saying their names or not because sometimes a lot of the times they did not want their faces to be shown in front of the camera nor did they want their names to be known but they still wanted to get the message out and spread the word the conspiracies were amongst us and it was up to us to keep our eyes and ears open and aware and oh give me a break yeah i was happy to work on those programs for an extra buck here and there but i could tell that that was way more paranoia than i would ever be able to handle i mean after the photo money incident at school i can i was certain the paranoia was an uncomfortable feeling that i was going to try to avoid the rest of my life good grief this is just getting to be too much i mean how long had i been down at this place like how the hell did i know all of these people by name how had i worked on all of these programs how on earth what the it's no wonder i wanted my own show i had even worked on uh music programming like harrigan after hours which was kind of a special treat for a kid considering it was broadcasted at midnight on saturday nights usually that's kind of late for a tike but when you're the camera guy you kind of got to show up so there you go and jay burns was a fantastic director to work for as was marty holden a fantastic audio guy to work for i kind of learned from both of those guys just by watching them and getting tips as well getting tutored but oh man there was one other idea i suppose that could work i mean it's not the most creative idea in the world and there were other shows you know that were doing this idea already but the thing is is this idea it took style and it took charisma it took that that certain kind of pizzazz if you will you know what i mean folks you know what i'm talking about i'm talking about talk shows hi all kinds of friends i mean there was art machine doing uh i don't want i can't put my brain on that because i friends are doing sometimes like for the expert he would hang out in the control room yeah he was so cool he didn't need dude bring in arthur was a pretty cool guy i mean i had taught him how to juggle after all yes you heard me juggle you know i was a bad kid i was awesome kind of a nerd i had several of the klutz spelled with ak books so sacking juggling yo-yoing and origami oh boy i guess i had more than just a few klutz books anyways also jay burns had a program j show though when he wasn't directing he was hosting that and directing kind of like oh what else that was there i guess there was a miguel ortega one hip to the who was kind of like a talk show man it's already comfortable in the control working the mixer board she kind of get more comfortable with grass valley picture time definitely complicated the control room though as far as i was concerned it was going to take me time to master that although i had heard about the amiga video toaster that would be getting installed soon which kind of kept me excited and not completely focused on the grass valley brain power for the coaster at some point which was already familiar to me thanks to network programming like home improvement with tim allen otherwise known as tim toolman taylor from tool time with his al borland or perhaps vice versa as it looked on the program yeah al boron was opposed tim was the psychic all i knew i hardly even like it was like i was made for this and i wasn't going to let the opportunity go waste no i was not i appreciated what was in front of me i had the perfect opportunity to take advantage and just become the ultimate tv guy if you will and believe it or not there was actually role models available in pop culture in the form of wayne and garth party time excellent oh yeah there was that kind of a talk show as well which i suppose i have already told you about the forbidden zone with marty catola and cliff campbell and their friends like jason kingman uh chris robichaud justice and uh well as time went on there are people like felix and well you know what just go look it up okay but yeah i could do a a talk show like that yeah yeah kinda i wait a minute wait a minute of course i would do a talk show like that why wouldn't i want to copy wayne and garth i mean all you had to do was see wayne's world in the motion picture theater to know that they have an awesome lifestyle that they're super popular but like of course that's it i got it i'm gonna do a talk show and it'll be kind of like wayne's world but it'll be kind of like i don't know a little bit like the forbidden zone i guess because well i mean yeah yeah it all made sense it all made sense you guys it all made sense now i think i i think i had found my calling as a producer yeah oh my god it was it was like a bell had dinged in my head it was like a light bulb had appeared over my head it was like it was like i got it i understood i man okay uh and it was a good thing too because my appointment was in a little bit yeah my faq appointment my cable cast appointment i figured things out just in the nick of time and so yes it was my time to shine as my mom drove me down to the studio i was just elated and lost in a world of my own daydreaming fantasizing and figuring out what kind of program i was going to have oh it was just a daydream come true almost yes but unfortunately while i was daydreaming about my fantasy wayne's world or rather zotz world if you will yeah i i hadn't bothered to think of things like well let's just say logistical things like a title or um you know a schedule i didn't know whether i was gonna be an evening program or a daytime i didn't know anything i hadn't figured that out all right i didn't really i don't know i was just a little kid i i hadn't really thought that stuff was important i thought that the the content the programming you know what i was going to be doing in front of the camera like i thought that was the important stuff to think about and that gave me plenty to think about but oh yeah being a producer well there's a lot of variables factors and things to consider and things that you must decide upon so yeah that first appointment was a little bit embarrassing a little bit awkward and quite humbling but not fruitless no it actually led to a taped program yes it was uh after talking about all of the various things that a producer had to consider it was decided i had been steered in the direction of a taped program uh just to get my feet wet you know that's basically the way i looked at it and the way the staff explained it to me and uh that worked it made sense you know it's like uh like training wheels for tv if you will you know why go live at first when you could you know keep your training wheels on and continue with the taped programming i had already proven myself as an expert editor having already made several productions in the editing days like my skateboarding productions um yeah so we scheduled some field camera checkout appointments and when i say a few i mean like a dozen because that's the way it worked all right and uh yes um scheduled some editing bay time as well in between the camera field the field camera checkouts and i did not actually have a scheduled cable cast time slot yet it was decided that uh we would figure that out after i had my first program ready for submission so we went ahead and scheduled another cable cast appointment as well considering that this cable cast appointment had basically been turned into a field production and editing bay facilitator appointment they were flexible like that down there they were cool like that so now it was time to figure out even more logistical stuff like what was i gonna do once i got my field camera you know i was just a kid i think you all know that so i didn't quite have a car or transportation and i mean i wasn't gonna ride my bike with a gigantic ag 455 panasonic svhs camcorder stuffed inside of a hard shell case no so once again my mom was gonna help me a bit because she was cool like that and who else was i gonna turn to for help i had already made many friends allies and associates down there at the studio and well as it turned out i would turn to my fellow associate and buddy jason kingman because my my straight edge buddy and pal he'd had me over to his house before for the super bowl when the dallas cowboys and the buffalo bills were playing i believe it was um and yay had me over for uh video games like nhl 92 i reckon by electronic arts for sega genesis and uh while i was over he even uh played a little bit of bass guitar i guess that's what he had been doing you know until i got there you know and uh i even got to hear a little bit of his so-called straight edge punk rock which sounded a little bit different from the thrash metal that i usually heard on the forbidden zone thrash metal like scatter brains mega death yeah no this straight edge punk rock stuff it was a little bit faster i think or maybe it was a little bit more aggressive no well i guess thrash metal and punk they were both pretty aggressive especially when i compared it with the blues classic rock stylings and folk tunes that my father had played for me around the house growing up but you know i'd already experimented with music having listened to jazz checking out different cassette tapes and compact discs for my disc man from the tucson public library stuff like miles davis theolonius monk chick korea uh winton and branford marsalis oh goodness gracious the jazz crusaders did i already say the bird charlie parker john coltrane miles davis those guys man the horn players whether it be woodwind or non oh something about the jazz horn was always really really the bee's knees it was it was it was really hip but yeah i turned to jason jason kingman because well he was my buddy kinda kind of like a big brother and i was uh helping him to produce his own program gonna have to look this up on the internet archive i think it was called time's up i think that's what it was called you know jason he was uh he he sometimes could have a lot to say you know like if the topic was something like the musical group the doors right or if uh the topic was uh something like nhl hockey and it that's kind of redundant considering national hockey league hockey yeah but anyways um or straight edge punk rock like judge the gorilla biscuits uh or maybe just nardcore which i never heard him say but now i know that bands like rich kids on lsd and other mystic record label bands are typically referred to as nard core from oxnard california anyway man i'm like pacing back and forth here i'm sweating i'm so excited this was so exciting starting my own program like i'm still i'm getting high just thinking about it my heart's pounding my my head's sweating holy [ __ ] i'm out of breath i was so excited you guys i was starting my own show and i even had help from my mom from jason freaking the world was my oyster i probably could have got help from anybody i mean i helped with so many programs already i merely had to ask you know probably helped to say please considering i wasn't really gonna be coughing up money for anybody i mean yeah i made a good chunk of change working down there but i wasn't just about ready to part with it you know not yet all right wiping the sweat from my forehead catching my breath ah yeah all right you guys so yeah i was gonna ask jason to like hang out you know like because the thought of being in front of a camera by myself it wasn't terrifying or anything it wasn't it wasn't like unheard of it was i was willing to do that if i had to but it sounded daunting you know i mean let's just say i hadn't had a whole lot of experience talking to myself if you will at that point i mean unless talking to my care bears counts but yeah no that doesn't because that's kind of like having an audience or having guests if you will so yeah i was not that good at talking to myself yet so having a co-host seemed very logical and i was kind of banging ideas back and forth like you know i'd call jason and say hey when we uh check out the camera this weekend where do you think we should go what do you think we should do what do you think what do you think and he would just sort of say in his nonchalant laid-back you know uh what's what he was saying he didn't say a whole lot unless he had something to talk about like the doors like i said already so he'd basically say just like oh i don't know you know whatever and i'd just be like oh well because i had some ideas i mean i don't know i've heard about some stuff he'd be like oh cool and uh i brought up uh this crazy idea that i'd been dying to try yes folks there was a new trend in town that involved go-karts yeah it was called ice track racing though it wasn't an actual ice track it was more like a slick metal track that had been painted blue but uh it looked fun as heck i'd seen a commercial on mtv or something like that and yeah i had driven past the circular track on the way to tucson mall once or twice and had decided i had to try this and figured that was just the kind of action-packed thing that would look good on camera uh-huh so yeah i basically called jason to say we were going go-kart racing at the ice track for the weekend and uh he'd better be ready to race because uh i was going to be yeah so it was going to be a competitive time i guess uh i had the camera check out on friday or something like that because we didn't hit the ice track until saturday but to get some practice in i had decided to go to the local pet store i was a fan of reptiles i found them fascinating so going to reptile solutions the best reptile pet store in town was the sensible thing also it was right down the street from my dad's so it was like uh a great idea i thought i got to check out iguanas pythons chameleons all kinds of fascinating dinosaur-like creatures and their bright colors were a great practice for the camera considering there were things like tint exposure chroma or brightness you know i had to get familiar with this stuff as a producer i was already familiar as a field crew person but i mean and ah what the hell i'd done the skateboard stuff but these this is different well i'm running out of breath again slow down j quit pacing oh that's so cool uh i suppose the ice track would be a lot like the skateboarding programming that i had produced already due to the fact that these go-karts are going to be gone fast and would probably require high speed shutter mode on these broadcast quality super vhs panasonic ag 455 camcorders yes yes although i did not actually have super vhs videotape available to for my production at this time i still knew that the regular consumer grade vhs videotape would still look pretty snazzy so yes after going to the pet shop and calibrating the cameras to make sure that colors were especially bright i knew that the blue ice track would be showing up great and i had also practiced with the microphone the handheld sm 57 industry standard microphone manufactured by sure was uh functioning just fine there was no problem with the xlr cable nor the adapter that was required to go into the uh eighth of an inch mini jack on the camcorder yeah yeah folks it was pretty dope you know we were just kind of hanging out talking about the track me and jason my mom was kind of filming you know good times good times getting psyched up for the race trying to get a competitive mindset you know and then it was time to hit the track and uh well it was a bit of a disaster i wasn't very good on the ice track i could handle the go-kart just fine but this ice track was so slippery i kept ended up i i basically kept ending up backwards on the track going in the reverse direction which well let's just say i ended up with some bruises on my chest from the safety belt yeah going reverse in the middle of a race is not a great idea it's a good way to end up in a collision but luckily go-karts aren't you know that dangerous but yes after a race or two my chest was feeling kind of banged up and bruised i was feeling a little bit embarrassed all of a sudden my smack talk felt a little bit stupid a little bit uh out of place and uh i was wondering what the hell i was gonna do so i noticed there was a video game arcade nearby oh yeah so it only made sense to go in there and showcase the games and continue to smack talk a little bit about what a great gamer i was and well believe it or not that ate up a good chunk of time that the race and the arcade and talking about stuff we had a whole program like right there it was it was it was it was time to call it so we uh started to wrap things up say goodbye to people there at the track made sure to say the name of the place and the address you know because the owners were excited at the prospect of free advertising in fact i even think we got to race for free yeah i think that might have been the beginning of my uh lucrative and uh my sleazy producer side if you will trying to figure out how to get stuff for free out of life for the sake of making good programming but that was merely an afterthought no just getting the program off the ground and up and running was the only thing i had in mind and uh well we were well on our way time to get editing and you know stuff yes the future looked bright why in no time i was sure i was gonna be ready for live block programming let me tell you man so exciting so exciting you guys yes so we got our little taped program made i believe we were calling it i won't forget at that time i think because well i think jason proposed the uh the title um then again i don't know maybe that was when we were live in the studio i might have to look this up but uh i know he came up with i won't forget kind of as a reminder so he wouldn't forget to show up to the program of course uh i didn't really get it at the time i just thought it was you know one of those cool funny things that teenagers come up with you know like like zot for example you know i didn't necessarily understood i didn't necessarily understand everything you know that was happening around me but i knew it was cool i knew it had to be cool because it just had to be but now that our tape program was a hit if you will uh it was time to consider the live programming yes actually though we had planned on doing a lot more tape programming uh we'd scheduled like i had had more uh checkouts for cameras scheduled and you know editing days scheduled but guess what an opportunity had presented itself folks yes yes i was pretty good friends with the staff at the television studio the facilitators and people like jimmy thomas robert ashley um whoo uh larry biser um i think like marcella and cindy were facilitators too at the time or maybe cindy was down in master control more i don't know but yeah i was i was pretty tight with everybody you know and i had caught wind i'd heard i'd heard that uh there was a great opportunity available that yes there was live programming that could be made evening night time programming the best type of live programming of course the coolest type but this was this was special indeed folks this was live programming it wasn't going to be made at the tv studio say what yeah there's gonna be uh well i mean there wasn't there was not gonna be there was basically nobody knew about this it was uh it was a live programming that could be made from a remote location remote location what does that even mean what what are we gonna have wireless cameras or do we got satellites now what's going on well not quite thought no there's actually an installation across the street over by at the cafe of all places there's like uh a live well it's not live but it could be at any moment yes uh a potentially live line a live telecommunications line suitable for the transmission of cable television signals whoa wait a minute now now all right all right let me make sure i got this straight because i'm just like a dropout i'm just a middle school dropout i'm just a bad kid just this just this kid that like you know ex-smoker just a little just a crazy hyper little troublemaker video game playing go-kart wrecking you know kid not too bright but if i heard you correctly you're telling me that there is a live table line across the street that we could transmit from and that nobody knows about it that like basically i could be the most unique person down there um whoa sign me up like ding ding ding ding i'm ready now yeah forget this training wheels crap i'm done with the training wheels who needs training wheels i i gotta i gotta oh man we'll be we got a whole show planned okay let me tell you yeah where do i sign where do i sign do you does my mom need to sign does jason need to sign does anybody does let me sign so uh yes that was the beginning of a uh of a monumental event in in tucson public access television history what ended up being only a two-episode production for yours truly ended up becoming a marathon television experience of unparalleled unparalleled proportions down the road in the form of instant access otherwise no uh otherwise known as instant access alley live and also random access otherwise known as random access alley live uh you know basically uh i got the ball rolling for some really cool stuff but i guess that live line hadn't been used in a long time but it had just been waiting for somebody like me you know some kind of some kind of troublemaking bad kid or i don't know maybe maybe i was more like a prodigy wonderkind in the making geez i guess we'll just have to wait and see you know uh i guess the tape will speak for itself if you will or if it will but yes folks exciting times indeed and well you can look that up it's uh listed under the users of the mighty medium that was like the first episode and i thought that was kind of a mouthful so i was like this is called the across the street show or something you know because everybody already knew where the public access tv studio was where tucson community cable corporation was there at 124 east broadway so naturally calling the program me across the street show was very informative to let people know we were across the street but oh yeah man just good times fun this the stuff i was saying in front of that camera i remember for the second episode for the across the street show i was deciding to let my freak flag fly if you will or my bad kid flag saying crazy things starting out the program with an intro line along the lines of hi i'm zot and i'm a drug using cult member i don't know really crazy look it up okay um really fun jeez guys so fun but it was exhausting those two episodes were an undertaking of unparalleled uh comparison like you know luckily i had an enthusiastic crew willing to help me all along the way um granted i believe they had you know visions of things like instant access down the road but i was willing to give it a shot but yeah after a couple episodes i was about ready for the studio yeah you know it was uh and plus though it was fun being able to interview and speak with people out on the street or in the cafe as the case may be i still hadn't really had my my phone caller my my live block i hadn't had my true studio producer experience like like i was really craving you know it it it was kind of like in my mind it was like a rite of passage you know i'd worked on so many programs in the studios studio a and you know hanging out in the green room getting ready you know and hanging out in the control room control room and controlling me like running out into the hallway to see what was on the television in front of the facilitator desk to make sure that the live signal was good and that the telephone numbers were up there so people knew to call yeah yeah i needed i needed my rite of passage so time to schedule some studio time and leave the cafe behind an unforgettable and fantastic experience though it was yeah it was time to hit up studio a i had some ideas i had some ideas and i also had video games on my mind believe it or not you know i guess maybe uh the go-kart episode was still ringing clear in my mind i was still kind of a little bit regretful that we hadn't spent more time in the arcade there it's true so yeah i think i decided i would make up for that by bringing my sega genesis into the studio and hooking it up to the tv yeah yeah yeah i still had lots of ideas yes this bad kid was indeed coming up with some some unique ideas almost like as if he was a prodigy or a wunderkind doing doing a good job of imitating one that's for sure and also it was now going to be time to take some phone calls and as long as jason showed up and he didn't forget because he said i won't forget remember as long as jason showed up i wouldn't be taking those calls alone so party on wayne party on garth wait wait wait wait cut do over party on jason party on jj oh yeah
