125 languages (spoken, not keyed in) of the greatest story never told...


i only speak english. at least i claim to.
i program computers, but never learned to CVS, Git, or nuthin'.
At least that's what I claim. So, I would like to be better at being a functioning member of my own community, wether I helped to start it, or not.
So, I figure I can learn to Git, and you can flex your spoken language skills, like some sorta Hoshi Sato. if U R down, that is, of course. cool?
ok then.
now you know the premise.

(i do not expect much. i don't know how to ask for help the right way. promote the word that i need help, the right way. and i certainly do not know how to publish an autobiographical video love story (a romance novel about loving video. that's a genre, right???)
but i hope for world peace. and i hope for help getting us there. and if we make this readable, that's a better attempt at world peace than i have ever seen in my lifetime. truthfully. and i met the dalai lama. seriously.
take care.)
